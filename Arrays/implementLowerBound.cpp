//Given a sorted array arr[] (following 0-based indexing) and a number target, find the lower bound of the target in this given array. The lower bound of a number is defined as the smallest index in the sorted array where the element is greater than or equal to the given number.
// Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller than the target, the lower bound will be the length of the array.
